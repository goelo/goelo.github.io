> Rather than chasing approval, I crave the quiet certainty that comes from within.

How often do we stop to examine the last year—let alone the last decade—of our lives? We recycle the same resolutions each January and drift through another 365 days. Yet life asks us to tackle difficult, meaningful things.

The Dragon Boat Festival marks a turning point for me. At thirty I finally pivoted away from a decade-long addiction.

### When habits erode ambition

I coasted into university, then promptly derailed. I failed more courses than I can count and disappeared into *World of Warcraft*. Even graduation was delayed. Somehow I still landed a job, but the bill eventually came due. Work required all the computer science fundamentals I had ignored, so nights and weekends vanished into remedial study.

Did I quit games? Not at all. Every evening I “rewarded” myself with at least half an hour of Azeroth. Friends warned me, but I insisted I deserved the break. In truth I was dodging the harder question: what kind of life did I want? Weekends meant marathon sessions until dawn, no meals, no social life—just a screen.

I tried chasing quick money by dabbling in iOS classes, but the courses gathered dust. Without changing the core habit nothing stuck.

Somehow I married. My wife and I rented a tiny apartment in Beijing while friends bought homes and advanced their careers. My parents couldn’t help financially, yet I still felt no urgency. Ten years slipped away.

### A breaking point

During the 2017 Dragon Boat Festival my wife asked for a divorce. She had hoped I’d eventually grow out of gaming; I hadn’t. Her words jolted me awake.

Step one: uninstall the game. It took seconds to remove, but weeks to silence the inner voice bargaining for “just one more weekend.”

Step two: study every night. If I couldn’t decide what to learn, I’d focus on whatever the industry demanded. At the time my company was shifting toward Python, so I spent evenings learning the language.

### From dreamer to doer

Our brains love comfort, so I set a small goal—study nightly after work. Simple, but surprisingly rare. Each weekend I reviewed the past seven days: Did I keep the promise? What got in the way? After a month I added a monthly retrospective.

Four or five months later I had a rhythm: two focused hours most nights, minimal excuses. My mindset shifted; I began seeking better ways to learn, filling commutes with audio courses, and tracking progress in detail. I joined Chen Huawei’s 21-day knowledge management bootcamp, discovering others wrestling with the same challenges.

### Habits unlocked

Consistent study led to broader changes. I tackled “meta-learning,” improved my self-management, and resisted distractions. I may have squandered ten years, but the last year restored momentum:

- Completed Udacity’s Intro to Machine Learning in four months and enrolled in the advanced nanodegree.
- Built a running habit—43 km across my first 11 days.
- Joined the Bear Academy community as a lifelong learner.
- Started writing regularly, inspired by mentors.

Most importantly, I trust myself to follow through. Once I commit, I finish.

### Keep it simple

The process isn’t complicated: reflect honestly, define the life you want, break the vision into daily actions, and adjust continuously. Simplicity makes consistency possible. Over time, consistency compounds into accelerated learning and new opportunities.

I traded ten years for this perspective. If you’re fighting similar battles with focus or self-discipline, I hope my story helps. Let’s keep each other accountable and build the lives we want.

And here’s a self-portrait drawn by my wife—a reminder of what I’m working to protect:
