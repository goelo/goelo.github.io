I started Udacity’s Intro to Machine Learning nanodegree on 24 January 2018 and submitted my final project on 4 June—about four and a half months later. I averaged one to two hours of study each day.

### What I liked about the course

1. **Focused videos.** Each lesson covers a single concept in just a few minutes, followed immediately by a quiz or exercise to anchor the idea.
2. **Drip-fed projects.** You can’t unlock the next module without completing the current project, which prevents binge-watching and encourages steady progress. Mentors host WeChat groups for each milestone, and the peer support is surprisingly motivating.
3. **Project-first learning.** Every project must be implemented from scratch. The instructors pose the problem, maybe drop a hint, and you figure out the rest—reading docs, researching algorithms, debugging. It’s a great rehearsal for real work.
4. **Detailed reviews.** Each submission receives personalised feedback. Reviewers point out bugs, style issues, and opportunities to improve. One of my projects took four iterations; every round taught me something new.
5. **Live Q&A and community events.** Regular livestreams let you ask instructors direct questions, and occasional challenges provide extra accountability (plus swag).

### Why pay for a course?

Could I have stitched together free resources? Possibly. But paying saved time, provided a clear roadmap, and came with built-in accountability. The key, of course, is making sure you’re ready to commit before swiping your card.

Before enrolling I had browsed countless articles on Google, Baidu, and Zhihu. The sheer volume of machine-learning topics felt overwhelming. Udacity’s curriculum eased me in—from Python basics to data analysis to core algorithms—connecting the dots in a structured way. Once you reach the advanced material you still need self-directed study, but the foundation is solid.

If you’re anxious about falling behind, focus on building learning momentum instead of raw speed. When I enrolled I double-checked that I could dedicate one to two hours nightly. This time I stayed the course.

The main takeaway: persistence is both an attitude and a skill.

If you’re unsure about committing, sample Udacity’s free courses first. Treat finishing them as a test of your consistency. Once you’re comfortable, consider upgrading—you’ll still find discount codes online if you need them.

This intro program won’t be my last. Next up: the advanced machine learning nanodegree. I want to keep sharpening my skills and applying them to real problems.

If you plan to enrol, you can use my referral code `4BED019B` for a ¥300 discount (new students only), or hunt down other codes.

Stay curious and keep learning. As Steve Jobs said, “Stay hungry, stay foolish.”
