I recently spoke with a colleague who dislikes her current role. She’s afraid time is running out to switch careers, so she keeps dabbling in Python and machine learning. Each attempt stops halfway when life interrupts. Sound familiar?

Too much anxiety leads to two common traps:

1. **Squirrel syndrome**—hoarding articles, tutorials, and courses without digesting them.
2. **Restlessness**—jumping between plans without sticking to one long enough to see progress.

How do we escape? Three habits help: **clarify goals, act consistently, review regularly.**

### Clarify the goal

Grab a sheet of paper. On the left, describe where you are today; on the right, describe where you want to go. Break the gap into skills to acquire—basic, intermediate, advanced—and identify your current level. A large vision becomes a series of concrete milestones. You stay aware of the big picture while working on manageable tasks.

### Commit to long-term action

Starting is easy; sustaining the effort is hard. Social media is full of 21-day challenges, but few people keep them up for a year. Lasting change comes from years of repetition. Once you know the target, invest your evenings and commutes in the missing skills. Focus beats FOMO.

### Review and adjust

Learning needs a feedback loop. Besides sharing what you’ve learned, schedule retrospectives—weekly or monthly—to note wins, shortcomings, and emotional state. These notes guide how you allocate time going forward.

Product builder Storm Zhang summed it up well: “Anxiety is normal. Having none means you lack ambition. But there’s no need to be overwhelmed—do the work in front of you.”

Let’s channel that energy into steady progress rather than endless worry.
