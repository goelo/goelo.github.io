> “The best time to plant a tree was ten years ago. The second-best time is now.”

I scan GitHub Trending every morning and stumbled across a “100 Days of Machine Learning” repository. It looked perfect for beginners—and for building consistency. I helped translate the material into Chinese so more people could participate.

<!--more -->

The English repo has already earned thousands of stars; the Chinese fork is still small but growing. To keep learners accountable I created a WeChat group and asked everyone to log progress in a shared Shimo document. Each person has a dedicated page that can be exported as a PDF at the end of the challenge.

### How we run it

- **Milestone groups.** We celebrate at 15, 30, 60, and 100 days. Reaching a milestone moves you into a new chat. The goal is to maintain momentum and avoid the “three-day monk” syndrome.
- **Weekday check-ins.** We only count workdays so weekends can be used for reflection. If a lesson takes longer than expected, slow down—mastery matters more than speed. Participants pursuing other topics are welcome; the spirit is daily practice, not just machine learning.
- **Shared knowledge base.** Questions and answers go into a FAQ folder so newcomers benefit from past discussions.
- **Action over talk.** Ultimately, lasting change comes from doing the work.

### Results so far

We’re at day 13 (weekday count). Many members have already carved out daily study time and can see progress.

Change is never easy. You need a clear goal and relentless effort. Industries may feel crowded, but perseverance quickly thins the ranks. The people who rise are the ones who keep showing up.

If you’d like to join, reach out via the WeChat QR code in the public account and I’ll add you to the group. Let’s escape our comfort zones together.
