It has been a while since I updated the blog. Time to wrap up 2018 and reset for the year ahead—my first attempt at a true annual review.

<!-- more -->

Last year I cut most entertainment, focused on learning, launched both a public account and this blog, and doubled down on self-management. There were anxious patches, but with patience I transitioned from telecommunications into the internet industry right at the end of the year.

For 2019 I want to turn “knowledge into action” across a few areas:

#### Strengthen English reading

Working in a multinational improved my English, but I still can’t read fluently enough. I’ll keep pushing.

#### Run 5 km without stopping

Health underpins everything. I exercised far too little last year—even though my company offers gym equipment. This year I’ll dedicate three evenings a week to training.

#### Finish *Computer Systems: A Programmer’s Perspective* and *Algorithms*

Foundational theory defines the ceiling of our technical growth. New frameworks appear constantly, but the core principles endure. Mastering the fundamentals matters most.

#### Keep publishing on the blog and WeChat

My posting cadence dipped in the second half of 2018. In 2019 I’ll increase both quantity and quality so the writing compounds into real expertise.

That’s enough for now—no need to overload the plan.

A final reminder to myself: never assume I’m working harder than others. Plenty of people push far beyond what I’m doing. The only reasonable response is to keep improving.

Here’s to a diligent 2019. Happy New Year!
